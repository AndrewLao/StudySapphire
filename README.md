# StudySapphire
CMPE 195 Senior Design Project

By default the frontend runs on port 3000 while the backend runs on port 3001

## To run frontend:

Navigate to the sapphire folder in your terminal and then to the frontend folder

`npm install` or `npm i`

`npm run dev`

## To run backend:

Navigate to the backend folder in the sapphire directory

`npm install` or `npm i`

`node ./server.js` or `nodemon ./server.js`

### For development

Use `npm install` or `npm i` first if the project was recently updated. This avoids errors with packages not existing.

Check component imports within App.jsx for the main components used. The folder names within the components folder are also the same name
as the main component used.
